We present DrivAerNet++, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for aerodynamic car design. DrivAerNet++ comprises 8,000 diverse car designs modeled with high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The dataset includes diverse car configurations such as fastback, notchback, and estateback, with different underbody and wheel designs.

## Design Parameters

Design parameters for the generation of the DrivAerNet++ dataset. Several geometric parameters with significant impact on aerodynamics were selected and varied within a specific range. These parameter ranges were chosen to avoid values that are either difficult to manufacture or not aesthetically pleasing.

## Shape Variation

DrivAerNet++ covers all conventional car designs. The dataset encompasses various underbody and wheel designs to represent both internal combustion engine (ICE) and electric vehicles (EV). This extensive coverage allows for comprehensive studies on the impact of geometric variations on aerodynamic performance. By including a diverse set of car shapes, DrivAerNet++ facilitates the exploration of aerodynamic effects across different vehicle types, supporting both academic research and industrial applications.

Each 3D car geometry is parametrized with 26 parameters that completely describe the design. To create diverse car designs, we used two main morphing methods: morphing boxes and direct morphing. For a detailed description of the design parameters, their ranges, lower and upper bounds, please refer to the paper.

## Importance of Dataset Diversity 

Dataset diversity and shape variation are crucial for developing robust deep learning models in aerodynamic car design. By providing a wide range of car shapes and configurations with high-fidelity CFD, DrivAerNet++ enables models to generalize better, supports exploration of unconventional designs, and enhances understanding of how geometric features impact aerodynamic performance.

## Dataset Annotations
In addition to the CFD simulation data, our dataset includes detailed annotations for various car components (29 labels), such as wheels, side mirrors, and doors. These annotations are instrumental for a range of machine learning tasks, including classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. The comprehensive labeling can also facilitate automated CFD meshing processes by providing precise information about different car components. By incorporating these labels, our dataset enhances the
utility for developing and testing advanced algorithms in automotive design and analysis.

## ✏️ Sketch-to-Design Extension

Car design is not just an engineering challenge — it's an art form.  
To bridge the gap between conceptual creativity and computational design, we extend DrivAerNet++ with new modalities: 2D hand-drawn sketches and photorealistic renderings.
